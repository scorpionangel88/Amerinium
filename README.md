# Amerinium
Text-based, strategy-based miner game with toybox design elements. 

Amerinium is an open-source, text-based, strategy-based shooter and space mining game that wants the density of Dwarf Fortress. It is a long-term development project that attempts to provide realistic space mining and space combat to a command-line interface. The goal with the code is to have a dense and editable game that the user can customize to have different game components entirely from another user's copy. Yes, you	can completely change the game yourself, and even expand upon	it if you know Python coding.

Beginning development in early 2022, the game is currently evolving. The story will be a psychological thriller.

## amerinium.py - 
being the hackiest codesheet so far, this is the main bunch of code that takes all of the other source files into account to pull together the main gaming experience. it teaches you the location of what you should be editing to bring the game to the most desired point.

## amplanets.py - 
this is where planets are designed. you can use the already existing code to design planets of your own.

## deepinv.py - 
the repository where all information related to the different mine-able materials is kept.	

## amatomic.py - 
this is the pricing of each chemical, including the algorithm that determines the	exact amount of	currency that	the user receives for their mining efforts.

The main developer is a transgender female cyberpunk junkie who enjoys the themes of Communism, Astrology and Magick/Divination. I try to be nice to others so please be nice to me.
